Dataset used: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

## Key Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Employed Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in various crime types and their locations.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured data consistency and alignment using Pandas DataFrame for initial data checks.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed models to predict future crime occurrences, focusing on crime types and victim demographics, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 46,245.75 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 54,722.77.

## Implementation
- **Data Exploration**: Utilized EDA techniques to analyze the crime data, creating visualizations to highlight key trends.
- **Model Development**: Built predictive models to forecast crime rates, using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Findings
- Identified key crime types and their distribution across various Los Angeles areas.
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns over time, assisting in predictive analysis.

## Conclusion
This project not only provided insightful data on the crime landscape of Los Angeles but also demonstrated the power of data science and machine learning in predictive analytics. The skills and methodologies applied here can be extended to other domains for data-driven decision-making.
